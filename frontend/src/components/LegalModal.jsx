TERMS OF SERVICE
Last updated: May 2026

1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS
By downloading or using the Kabutar mobile application ("App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, do not use the App. Kabutar ("we", "our", "us") is a peer-to-peer parcel delivery marketplace operated in India.

2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE
Kabutar is a technology platform that connects individuals who are travelling ("Travellers") with individuals who need to send parcels ("Senders") on the same route. Kabutar does not itself provide delivery or courier services. We are a marketplace — all delivery arrangements are between Travellers and Senders directly.

3. ELIGIBILITY
You must be at least 18 years of age to use Kabutar. By using the App, you confirm you are 18 or older and legally capable of entering into a binding agreement under Indian law.

4. KYC VERIFICATION
Travellers must complete KYC (Know Your Customer) verification before posting trips. KYC may include government-issued photo ID and a live selfie. Kabutar reserves the right to reject or revoke KYC status at its discretion. Senders are encouraged but not required to complete KYC.

5. USER RESPONSIBILITIES
You agree to:
• Provide accurate, complete, and current information
• Keep your account credentials confidential
• Not impersonate any person or misrepresent your identity
• Use the App only for lawful purposes
• Treat all other users with respect and dignity

6. TRAVELLER RESPONSIBILITIES
As a Traveller, you agree to:
• Carry only parcels you have inspected and accepted
• Deliver parcels safely and on time as agreed
• Not carry prohibited items (see Section 8)
• Communicate promptly with Senders via in-app chat
• Upload photo proof at pickup and delivery

7. SENDER RESPONSIBILITIES
As a Sender, you agree to:
• Accurately describe parcel contents, weight, and dimensions
• Declare the true value of parcels
• Not send prohibited items (see Section 8)
• Have parcels ready at the agreed pickup time
• Make payment as agreed with the Traveller

8. PROHIBITED ITEMS
You must not send or carry any of the following:
• Cash, currency, or negotiable instruments
• Illegal drugs or controlled substances
• Weapons, ammunition, or explosives
• Counterfeit goods or stolen property
• Perishable food items without prior agreement
• Flammable, hazardous, or toxic materials
• Live animals
• Adult content or obscene material
• Any item prohibited under Indian law

Violation may result in immediate account termination and legal action.

9. PAYMENTS
All payment arrangements are made directly between Travellers and Senders. Kabutar does not process, hold, or guarantee any payments. Users are responsible for agreeing on fair prices and completing payment as mutually agreed.

10. RATINGS AND REVIEWS
After each delivery, both parties may rate each other. Ratings affect user visibility on the platform. Fake, misleading, or abusive reviews are prohibited and may result in account suspension.

11. CANCELLATION POLICY
Cancellations should be communicated as early as possible via in-app chat. Repeated no-shows or last-minute cancellations may result in account penalties or suspension.

12. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law:
• Kabutar is not liable for loss, damage, or theft of parcels
• Kabutar does not guarantee the quality, safety, or legality of items carried
• Kabutar's aggregate liability to any user shall not exceed ₹5,000
• We are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages

13. ACCOUNT TERMINATION
We may suspend or terminate your account at any time for violation of these Terms, fraudulent activity, or at our sole discretion with or without notice.

14. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
Any disputes between Travellers and Senders must first be attempted to be resolved amicably. If unresolved, disputes shall be subject to arbitration under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The seat of arbitration shall be Patna, Bihar, India.

15. GOVERNING LAW
These Terms are governed by the laws of India. Any legal proceedings shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Patna, Bihar.

16. CHANGES TO TERMS
We reserve the right to update these Terms at any time. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
